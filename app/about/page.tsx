            Hi again! Since you're here, I'm guessing you want to know a little
            about me. Alright, if you insist. I'm a Software Developer
            specializing in frontend development. I enjoy creating engaging and
            user-friendly experiences on the web. Fluent in TypeScript and
            React, I strive to deliver clean and accessible code while keeping
            the end user in mind. Collaboration is where I truly shine. I thrive
            when bouncing ideas off others and working together to solve
            problems. And when I'm not immersed in the world of tech, you'll
            probably find me buried in a good book of African literature or
            glued to the screen, indulging in some sci-fi movie marathon. Oh,
            and here's a little secret: I actually made a career switch from
            Medicine to Software Development! But let's keep that between us ðŸ˜‰
