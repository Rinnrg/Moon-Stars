          Hi again! Thanks for stopping by. If you're curious to learn more
          about me, well, here goes! I'm a Software Developer specializing in
          frontend development. I enjoy creating engaging and user-friendly
          experiences on the web.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fluent in TypeScript and React, I strive to deliver clean and
          accessible code while keeping the end user in mind. Collaboration is
          where I truly shine. I thrive when bouncing ideas off others and
          working together to solve problems.
          <br />
          <br />
          And when I'm not immersed in the world of tech, you'll probably find
          me buried in African literature or indulging in some sci-fi movie
          marathon. Oh, and here's a little secret: I actually made a career
          switch from Medicine to Software Development! But let's keep that
          between us ðŸ˜‰
